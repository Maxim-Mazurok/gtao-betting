      We're playing virtual roulette (without zero, just flipping a coin with
      50/50 chance), counting how many times we get red vs black. Blue line
      shows the expectation of how many times red should win (50%).
    </p>
    <canvas id="chart1"></canvas>
    <p>
      Based on the expected number of red wins, and the actual number of red
      wins, we're calculating the Chi Square value. Higher value shows deviation
      from the expected value.

    <p>
      Based on the Chi Square value, we're calculating the significance level.
      The higher the value (closer to 1), the more chances that the deviation is
      due to random chance. Low values (closer to 0) mean that the game is
      rigged.
