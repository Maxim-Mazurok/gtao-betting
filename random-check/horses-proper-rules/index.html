      Based on the expected number wins, and the actual number wins, we're
      calculating the Chi Squares. Higher value shows deviation from the
      expected value.

      Based on the Chi Square value, we're calculating the significance level.
      The higher the value (closer to 1), the more chances that the deviation is
      due to random chance. Low values (closer to 0) mean that the game is
      rigged.
